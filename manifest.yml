description: |
  This app will launch a Jupyter Notebook server on a production compute node.
  The Jupyter Notebook can be loaded either from an ACCRE GCC or Intel compiler
  toolchain or an installed Anaconda python distribution. Notebooks launched
  using the Anaconda distributions will only have the Python kernel and can
  optionally use a conda environment. Notebooks launched with the GCC or Intel
  compiler toolchains will also have Octave and R (Python 2 only) kernels
  available. The Tensorflow library is available with the GCC toolchain.
