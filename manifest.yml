  This app will launch a Jupyter Notebook server on a production compute node
  using either a pre-selected environment or a customized environment.

  For a pre-selected environment, the Jupyter Notebook can be loaded either
  from an ACCRE GCC or Intel compiler toolchain or an installed Anaconda
  python distribution. Such notebooks launched
  using the Anaconda distributions will only have the Python kernel and can
  optionally use a conda environment. Notebooks launched with the GCC or Intel
  compiler toolchains will also have Octave and R (Python 2 only) kernels
  available. The Tensorflow library is available with the GCC toolchain.

  For a customized environment you must select the Lmod modules that you
  wish to have loaded and optionally a python or conda virtual environment
  to use. In this case the capabilities of your notebook will depend on the
  modules you choose to load and possibly the packages installed in your
  virtual environment.
