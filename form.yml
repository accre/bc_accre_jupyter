      feature. If you wish to have OnDemand enabled on your group's
      custom gateway, please open a helpdesk ticket. If this box is

    help: |
      Select an option other than "Not Exclusive" in order to exclusively
      reserve a sever in its entirety. This will give you access to all CPU
      cores and memory available on the server, and your job will not be
      subject to termination if it tries to exceed its memory quota, although
      system-level out of memory errors may occur. The number of cores and
      memory will vary depending on the node allocated. To specifically reserve
      119GB or 246GB of memory, select one of those options. Note that a
      whole node reservation may require a longer wait in the queue so please
      make your request well ahead of the time you plan on using it.
    options:
      - [ "Not Exclusive", "no" ]
      - [ "Any Node", "any" ]
      - [ "119GB Memory", "119g" ]
