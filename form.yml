      Check this box if you wish to load a conda virtual environment. Note that
      you must install jupyter into your virtual environment in order for
      your packages to be available. If installed, the version of python in your
      conda environment will override the default version selected below.
      Note that python virtual environments using the venv or virtualenv packages
      are not yet supported but are planned for the near future.
